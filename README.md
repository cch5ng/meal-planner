## Meal Planner (working title)

* Help for faster meal planning and food shopping

1. Add recipe(s) to the application
2. This Week's Recipes: Select recipe(s) to shop for
   * The application will organize your shopping list by market section

* Motivation: This application is part of a larger system for food waste reduction. The rationale is that if you plan your meals better, you will purchase less food that goes to waste. But I Know(!) meal planning takes time. So I'd like to develop applications that make it easier to reduce food waste

* Benefits
  * Save money
  * Healthier diet (hopefully!)
  * Save time (with a little effort)
  * Reduce stress on the environment (overheating of methane gases from overflowing landfills)
